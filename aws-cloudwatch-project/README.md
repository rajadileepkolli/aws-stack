Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service provided by AWS (Amazon Web Services) that provides visibility into the performance and health of various AWS resources. It allows you to monitor metrics, collect and track log files, and set alarms to automatically react to changes in your AWS resources. This enables you to optimize the performance and availability of your applications and quickly troubleshoot any issues that may arise. CloudWatch can monitor resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets, as well as various other AWS services and custom metrics generated by your applications.
